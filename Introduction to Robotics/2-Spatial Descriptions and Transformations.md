##Positions, Orientations, And Frames  
The frame is an entity that contains both of positions and orientations, which can give a full description of an object.   
The position of a point in space (a coordinate system $\left\{A\right\}$) is described with a position vector of 3 freedoms like:
$$^AP=
\left[
\begin{matrix}
p_x\\
p_y\\
p_z
\end{matrix}
\right]
$$
